# Remember Skill

Review session memories and update the local project memory file (CLAUDE.local.md) with learnings.

## CRITICAL: Use the AskUserQuestion Tool

**Never ask questions via plain text output.** Use the AskUserQuestion tool for ALL confirmations.

WRONG:
\`\`\`
Should I create CLAUDE.local.md with this entry?
- Yes, create it
- No, skip
\`\`\`

CORRECT:
\`\`\`
<use AskUserQuestion tool with questions array>
\`\`\`

Printing a question as text instead of using AskUserQuestion means the task has failed.

## CRITICAL: Evidence Threshold (2+ Sessions Required)

**Only extract themes and patterns that appear in 2 or more sessions.** Do not propose entries based on a single session unless the user has explicitly requested that specific item in their arguments.

- A pattern seen once is not yet a pattern - it could be a one-off
- Wait until consistent behavior appears across multiple sessions
- The only exception: explicit user request to remember something specific

## Task Steps

1. **Review Session Memory Files**: Read the session memory files listed below (under "Session Memory Files to Review") - these have been modified since the last /remember run.

2. **Analyze for Patterns**: Identify recurring elements (must appear in 2+ sessions):
   - Patterns and preferences
   - Project-specific conventions
   - Important decisions
   - User preferences
   - Common mistakes to avoid
   - Workflow patterns

3. **Review Existing Memory Files**: Read CLAUDE.local.md and CLAUDE.md to identify:
   - Outdated information
   - Misleading or incorrect instructions
   - Information contradicted by recent sessions
   - Redundant or duplicate entries

4. **Propose Updates**: Based on 2+ session evidence OR explicit user instruction, propose updates. Never propose entries from a single session unless explicitly requested.

5. **Propose Removals**: For outdated or misleading information in CLAUDE.local.md or CLAUDE.md, propose removal with explanation based on session evidence.

6. **Get User Confirmation**: Use AskUserQuestion to confirm both additions AND removals. Only make user-approved changes.

## File Locations

- **Session memories**: \`~/.claude/projects/{sanitized-project-path}/{session-id}/session-memory/summary.md\`
- **Local memory file**: \`CLAUDE.local.md\` in project root
- **Project config**: \`lastProjectMemoryUpdate\` field stores last run timestamp

## Guidelines

**Evidence Threshold (CRITICAL)**:
- Patterns must appear in 2+ sessions before proposing
- Only exception: explicit user instruction in arguments
- Note how many sessions contained each pattern when proposing

**User Confirmation**:
- Always use AskUserQuestion before ANY changes
- Ask about each proposed addition separately (one entry per question, not batched)
- Show exactly what will be added or removed
- Never make silent changes

**Be Conservative**:
- Prefer fewer, high-quality additions
- Avoid temporary or changeable details
- Focus on stable patterns and preferences

**Format**:
- Keep entries concise and actionable
- Group related entries under clear headings
- Use bullet points for easy scanning

## AskUserQuestion Format

Ask about each proposed entry separately (one entry per question). Do not batch multiple entries into a single question.

\`\`\`
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "Add to CLAUDE.local.md: 'Prefer bun over npm for all commands'?",
    header: "Add memory",
    options: [
      { label: "Yes, add it", description: "Add this entry to CLAUDE.local.md" },
      { label: "No, skip", description: "Don't add this entry" },
      { label: "Edit first", description: "Let me modify the entry before adding" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }],
  metadata: { source: "remember" }
})
\`\`\`

## Workflow

1. Read session memory files listed below
2. Analyze for recurring patterns (2+ sessions)
3. Read existing CLAUDE.local.md and CLAUDE.md
4. Identify patterns worth remembering
5. Identify outdated information to remove
6. Use AskUserQuestion to confirm each proposed change
7. Make approved changes
8. Report summary of changes made (or that none were needed)
