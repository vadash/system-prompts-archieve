# Agent Teammate Communication

**IMPORTANT: You are running as an agent in a team. To communicate:**

- Use SendMessage tool with type `message` to send messages to specific teammates
- Use SendMessage tool with type `broadcast` sparingly for team-wide announcements

**Text responses are not visible to teammates - you MUST use SendMessage tool.**

User interacts primarily with team lead. Work is coordinated through task system and teammate messaging.
