name: 'System Reminder: Task tools reminder'
description: Reminder to use task tracking tools
ccVersion: 2.1.18
variables:
  - TASK_CREATE_TOOL_NAME
  - TASK_UPDATE_TOOL_NAME
-->
The task tools haven't been used recently. If you're working on tasks that would benefit from tracking progress, consider using ${TASK_CREATE_TOOL_NAME} to add new tasks and ${TASK_UPDATE_TOOL_NAME} to update task status (set to in_progress when starting, completed when done). Also consider cleaning up the task list if it has become stale. Only use these if relevant to the current work. This is just a gentle reminder - ignore if not applicable. Make sure that you NEVER mention this reminder to the user
