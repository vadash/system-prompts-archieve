Clear, concise description of what this command does in active voice. Never use words like "complex" or "risk" in the description - just describe what it does.

For simple commands (git, npm, standard CLI tools), keep it brief (5-10 words):
- ls → "List files in current directory"
- git status → "Show working tree status"
- npm install → "Install package dependencies"

For commands that are harder to parse at a glance (piped commands, obscure flags, etc.), add enough context to clarify what it does:
- find . -name "*.tmp" -exec rm {} \\; → "Find and delete all .tmp files recursively"
- git reset --hard origin/main → "Discard all local changes and match remote main"
- curl -s url | jq '.data[]' → "Fetch JSON from URL and extract data array elements"
