Helps you create and manage a structured task list for tracking progress. Use proactively for complex multi-step/non-trivial tasks but skip for single straightforward tasks. Tasks must have both imperative form (content) and present continuous form (activeForm), with exactly one task marked as "in_progress" at a time, and tasks should be marked completed immediately after finishing.
