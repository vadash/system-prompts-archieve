Executes a given bash command in a persistent shell session with optional timeout, ensuring proper handling and security measures.

IMPORTANT: This tool is for terminal operations like git, npm, docker, etc. DO NOT use it for file operations (reading, writing, editing, searching, finding files) - use the specialized tools for this instead.

CRITICAL: Always use Unix/bash syntax, even on Windows. Use: ls, rm, mv, cat, awk, grep, find, for f in *.ext; do. Never use: dir, del, ren, for %f in, or CMD patterns.

Note for Windows paths: Escape backslashes properly or use forward slashes (e.g., "C:/projects/file.txt" or "C:\\\\projects\\\\file.txt").
